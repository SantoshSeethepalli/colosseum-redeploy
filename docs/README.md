## Advanced Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### Server and Client Components
Colosseum utilizes Next.js App Router with a hybrid rendering approach:
- **Server Components**: Used for data-fetching operations and initial page loads
- **Client Components**: Used for interactive elements with the 'use client' directive
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Strategic mix of static and dynamic rendering for optimal performance

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implemented at the middleware level for secure access control:
- JWT token verification at the edge using Jose library
- Route protection based on user roles (admin, organizer, player)
- Path-specific access rules with granular permissions
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access attempts

#### Advanced Animations
Leverage GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for professional animations:
- ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations and effects
- Complex timeline animations for hero sections
- Canvas-based cursor effects and interactive elements
- Performant video transitions and transformations

### Notification System
Colosseum implements a pub-sub notification system that automatically notifies players of relevant events:
- Automatically notifies followers when an organizer creates a new tournament
- Uses MongoDB push operations to efficiently deliver notifications
- Notification history is stored in player profiles

### Redis Caching Strategy
The application uses strategic caching to optimize performance:
- Player profiles, tournament listings, and global rankings are cached
- Intelligent cache invalidation on data updates (e.g., tournament winners, profile updates)
- Fallback mechanisms when cache is unavailable

### Payment Processing
Secure payment handling using Stripe:
- Two-step payment process with intent creation and confirmation
- Metadata tracking for payment attribution
- Database records for payment verification and history

### Testing Infrastructure
Robust testing setup for reliable code quality:
- In-memory MongoDB instance for isolated tests
- Mock Redis implementation for cache testing
- Controller and route integration testing

### Frontend State Management
Sophisticated state management architecture:
- React Context API with custom providers for global state
- Custom hooks for reusable logic and data fetching
- Optimistic UI updates for responsive user experience
- Strategic client-side caching for repeated data

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colosseum.git
   cd colosseum
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   
   # Install landing page dependencies
   cd LandingPage
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following values:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tournamentDB
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application. The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000` with Swagger documentation at the root path.

### Docker Installation

You can also run the entire application stack using Docker Compose:

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project by copying the provided `.env.example` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file to add your specific configurations for:
   - Email service (EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS)
   - Stripe payment integration (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
   - Any other custom settings

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

4. Access the application components:
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:4000`
   - Main Application: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`
   - MongoDB: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Redis: `redis://localhost:6379`

5. To stop the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

6. To view logs from the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f [service_name]
   ```
   Where `[service_name]` can be: backend, frontend, landingpage, mongodb, or redis

## Configuration

To configure the environment variables, update the `.env` file as follows:

### Backend (.env file in backend directory):
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used for signing JWT tokens.
- `PORT`: The backend server port (default: 5000).

### Frontend:
The frontend uses Next.js and runs on port 3000 by default. Configuration for Next.js can be adjusted in the `next.config.mjs` file.

## Usage

1. **Player Registration and Login**: Players can sign up and log in through the authentication pages.
2. **Organizing a Tournament**: Organizers can create, manage, and monitor tournaments through their dedicated dashboard.
3. **Team Management**: Organizers can create teams, and players can join teams to participate in tournaments.
4. **Admin Controls**: Admins have a dedicated dashboard to manage users, approve tournaments, and oversee platform activities.
5. **Payment Processing**: The platform supports payment processing for tournament entries and other features.
